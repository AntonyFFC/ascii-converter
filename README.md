Converts .jpg images to text pictures

## Guide

Upon running the program, it will asc you to give the directory of your image. Remember that it must be a .jpg as the program doesn't know how to convert the .png empty pixels into ascii letters.

Next you should give the resolution of the ascii picture (number of pixels per ascii character). The larger this number, the smaller the end  picture will be, as each letter would stand for a bigger portion of the image.

Lastly you should give the number of ascii characters that will be used in this convertion. If you give less characters the picture will appear more flat, less sharp. However, if you give more characters, the picture will be more distinctive and sharp.

## Note

Remember that if you give too many charaters or the resolution larger that the picture, the end result might not be possible, so try out other combinations.

Have Fun!
